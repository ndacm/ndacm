# Resume Formatting Checklist

> From Prof. Matthew Morrison.

- Place **Name** big and bold at top of resume

- Include **contact information** under name (address, phone, email)

- Place your **Profile/Summary of Qualifications** under name and contact
  information

  - Always emphasize the skill level and experiences that directly relate to the
    position being sought
  - Articulate what you can bring to the position, not what you hope to gain
  - Be clear and concise

- List Employment and Project Experience sections next

  - Place in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
  - Include Position, Company, City/State and Dates Employed
  - List a minimum of 3 bullet points for each position
  - Write accomplishment bullet points
    - Start each bullet point with a power verb in past tense (even for current
      positions)
    - Answer who, what, when, where, why, and how to write a descriptive bullet
      point
    - Should describe more than just your duties - turn DUTIES into SKILLS
    - Include what IMPACT or CONTRIBUTION your actions had
    - Use numbers to quantify information (i.e., time frame, money)
  - Other categories can include:
    - Military Experience
    - Volunteer Experience (can provide bullet points or just list)
    - Awards/Recognition/Patents/Certifications (include dates)
    - Computer Skills
    - Language Proficiencies

- List **Education** after Experience

  - List the Institution, City/State
  - Include degree and major (i.e., B.B.A. Management)
  - Include graduation date only (i.e., May 2011)
  - List emphasis area, minor, and/or certificate if applicable
  - List cumulative and/or major GPA if 3.0 or above and Dean’s List/Honors
    Program if applicable

- Other Reminders:
  - Tailor information to position seeking and place most relevant information
    toward top of resume
  - Keep it to one or two pages. Should not be more than two pages regardless of
    number of years worked and jobs held.
  - Do not use the pronoun “I”. Write in third person, past tense, including
    current job.
  - Don’t use a template to format
  - Use 10pt. traditional font (Ariel, Times New Roman, etc.) and no less than
    .5 margins
  - Place dates on the right of the page
  - Stay consistent within format and layout (i.e., using italics, bolding
    items, etc.)
  - Don’t list “References available upon request” (create separate reference
    page if needed)
  - CHECK and RECHECK for spelling/grammatical errors
  - Add name and contact information to header or footer of second page
