# Creating Accomplishment Statement

> From Prof. Matthew Morrison.

Accomplishment statements are important to go beyond just your job
responsibilities. One way to do this is to think of the "5W's and an H" rule you
learned in school.

- **WHO:** Who did your job help? The company? Clients? Customers?
- **WHAT:** What happened with the results of the job? If you did research, was
  that information published? If you had to do a report what was done with that
  information? Include what RESULTS, IMPACT or CONTRIBUTION your actions had.
- **WHEN:** When did this happen? Daily? Weekly, Monthly? Talking about how
  often you did something is an easy way to show productivity in your job.
- **WHERE:** Where did your duties occur? Did you have to travel for a job? Were
  you responsible for interacting with people outside of your organization?
- **WHY & HOW:** Why did you do this? How did your job duties help the
  organizations ability to function?

::: tip TIPS

- Use your performance reviews to help you get started.
- Create a list of things you have been most proud of accomplishing.
- Use numbers to quantify information (i.e., time frame, money).

If you get really stumped on how to write your accomplishment statement break it
down you're your basic responsibilities and use the "Power Verbs for Your
Resume" document to get yourself started. Example â€“ Job responsibilities that
require using communication skills go to that section and pick the appropriate
word to start your statement.

Here is a sample of how to add content and valuable details to your resume. The
"details" will set you apart from other candidates and showcase your skills and
expertise appropriately.
